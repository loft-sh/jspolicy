You can remove jsPolicy from your cluster by uninstalling the Helm deployment and deleting all associated cluster-wide resources.

## Delete Helm Release
To uninstall jsPolicy, it is highly recommended to use Helm:
```bash
helm delete -n jspolicy jspolicy
```

**After** deleting the jsPolicy Helm release, you may also delete the corresponding namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace jspolicy
```

:::caution Delete Webhook
If you accidentially deleted the namespace without deleting the jsPolicy Helm release beforehand, you will have to remove the webhook manually or requests to your cluster may fail due to the failing webhook:
```bash
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration jspolicy
```
:::


## Delete CRDs (optional)
```bash
kubectl api-resources --api-group='policy.jspolicy.com' -o name | xargs kubectl delete crd
```

:::warning Data Loss
Deleting the jsPolicy CRDs will also remove all jsPolicy objects inside your cluster, i.e. all `JsPolicy`, `JsPolicyBundle`, and `JsPolicyViolations` objects.
